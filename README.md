# Soundrise

SoundRise is an application designed to help people with communication difficulties, especially children. The application provides an intuitive interface that allows the user to practise speech therapy voice exercises independently. The interface consists of a sun that symbolises the user's voice and is animated according to the tonal and timbral characteristics of the voice itself: it analyses these vocal characteristics and displays a correspondent visual feedback in real time.
